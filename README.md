# CPP_LAB  

Welcome to **CPP_LAB**, a repository dedicated to my journey of diving back into C++. C++ was the first programming language I learned, and through this repository, I aim to rediscover its depth and versatility. My goal is to make C++ my primary programming language once again, focusing on modern practices and advanced concepts.  

## Why CPP_LAB?  
- To revisit and strengthen my understanding of C++.  
- To explore modern C++ features and best practices.  
- To document my learning process and projects for reference and improvement.  

## What You’ll Find Here  
This repository will include:  
1. **Code Snippets**: Short programs demonstrating key C++ concepts like memory management, object-oriented programming, and modern C++ features.  
2. **Mini-Projects**: Small-scale applications to put my knowledge into practice.  
3. **Learning Notes**: Personal notes on concepts and techniques, including best practices for efficient C++ programming.  

## Topics Covered  

Here’s a checklist of topics I plan to go through. I’ll update this as I complete each one:  

- [x] Level__00_01_02 Basics of C++  
  - First program, variables, datatypes, Const Variable, NameSpaces, Typedef Aliases  
  - Arithmetic operations, Type Conversion, User Input, cmath libray, Hypotenuse calculation
  - conditional operators(if-else-elif, switch), Ternary Operators, logical operators, Temp Conversion, string manipulation
- [x] Level__02_03 Basics of C++ 
  - while, do while, for loops, do_while, break, continue.
